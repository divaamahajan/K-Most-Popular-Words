# K Most Popular Words
## The Problem Statement
Design and Implement an efficient java/python/scala code (or any language you prefer) to determine Top K most frequent/repeated words in a given dataset (example: K = 10). The objective here is to obtain the result with the least possible execution Time (or with the best performance on your computer). You can use the same k value across all the files. Please note that you need to skip the “stop” words such as ‘the’ – please see the list of stop words here: https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280


Execute your code on each of the three input data files separately. It is a good practice to execute your code initially on a 10 MB dataset (or any small text file) and then repeat on larger datasets.


Analyze the performance through different metrics such as running time, speedup, CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.  Or You can come up with any metrics that make sense for this application/program.
Present a detailed analysis of why you use a particular algorithm or a particular data structure to solve this problem.
NOTE:
'''The result should preserve case sensitivity i.e. words “Title” and “title” are considered as two different words.
The input dataset contains only English alphabets, white spaces and hyphen separated words i.e. “a-z”,”A-Z”,”\s”.'''
